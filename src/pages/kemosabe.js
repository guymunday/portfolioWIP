              website.

          The core value of Kemosabe is their "inch wide, mile deep" approach to
          their work. I brought this front and centre with a bold animation
          penetrating a "mile deep" throughout their projects.

          Working with the team, we approached the case studies with the same
          philosophy, refreshing the copy to really capture the "inch wide" and
          the "mile deep" of every project.
