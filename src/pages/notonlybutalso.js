              is project that my partner and I have launched over theÂ past few
              weeks. It's a new platform to shed light on the other roles that
              exist in theÂ creative industryÂ that don't often get talked about.
              Weâ€™re collecting together resources, interviews and more to help
              young creatives navigate these different roles â€“ What are they?
              Who does them? And what does it take to get into them?
